The labour movement trends to improve the economy of the working class
in general: defending positions, salarial conditions, ...

GNU trends to program by militant reasons, that's free in the gratis
sense, to generate a full operating sistem with General Public
License.

There are bussiness of rich men around of the free software, such as
Oracle with Larry Ellison (Java, Mysql, etc.), or Linus Torvalds with
the Linux kernel (used in servers, personal computers, or android)

GNU, with the Free Software Foundation is converted in a GNO of values
giving a ethical theory to make programming without a salary. In a
practical way, all philosophical analysis about a little ethical idea
about the technological fashion feature is ok, I'm not in
disagreement.

Richard Stallman has been many years speaking abouth ethics about the
software in the world and earn reputation about it, specially in
ideologies with more values, that's true in the left parties or trade
unions, too. But, he nevers has spoken about the economical
unequalities in the world.

The fact is the model GNU with Linux, that is, GNO + rich men is a
virical matter, because the ethical people is being more poor and the
people with the economy has more money.

Concluding, or this philosophy is integrated in standard political
structures: trade unions, political parties, or companies, or the
worker is working by no money.

I agree the GNU philosophy for the ethical scientific, because if you
can study, modify and redistribute your own software. You are
improving your work in the university (for instance: dissemination,
social reputation, etc.) creating public code.

Is GNU and/or FSF an organization without ethical? The answer is
not. But from my point of view, the voluntary work in any GNO has the
problem that you are focusing your effort a little point of the
society, with a trade union or political party you have a wide vision
about the society, if you are agree with the ideology, of course.

This article is a social alert about a philosophical empty in society
about unequalities derived in the software industry, creating a strong
social injustice in this moment of the history.

In this moment, I maintain twice project to think solutions to avoid
the economical injustices in relation with the software industry:
