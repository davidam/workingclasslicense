* Is the working class license an open source license?

The Open Source Definition implements "5. No discrimination against
persons or groups".

So, a possitive discrimination in a socialdemocracy sense is out of
Open Source Definition. To help to people with few resources, females,
or some minority, we must use another kind of licenses or other ideas.

You can visit [[https://opensource.org/osd][Open Source Definition]] to read the full definition.
