* Is the working class license an open source license?

The Open Source Definition implements "5. No discrimination against
persons or groups".

So, a possitive discrimination in a socialdemocracy sense is out of
Open Source Definition. To help to people with few resources, females,
or some minority, we must use another kind of licenses or other ideas.

You can visit [[https://opensource.org/osd][Open Source Definition]] to read the full definition.
* Is it possible make this license compatible with GPL?
This license is not compatible with GPL. But if you are the copyright
holder, you can consider create a dual license for your
software. Perhaps you want make the most new releases for the working
class and give GPL software with other versions.
