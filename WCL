 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The Working Class License is a free, copyleft license for software
and other kinds of works only for the working class. With this
license, the employer class can't stealing our freedom with more money
without break the copyright laws.

  The licenses for most software and other practical works are
designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By
contrast, conventional copyleft licenses such as GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all
versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all
its users.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom for all
people. We understand that there are a strong economical gap in all
society due to the software industry. This license allows that
software works done by the working class to be enjoyed by the
companies that is creating this situation. The freedom is caused by
the economical situation, too.

  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive
or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they
know their rights.

  Developers that use the WORKING CLASS LICENSE (WCL) protect your rights
with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer
you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute
and/or modify it.

  For the developers' and authors' protection, the WCL clearly explains
that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
authors' sake, the WCL requires that modified versions be marked as
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
authors of previous versions.

  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
have designed this version of the WCL to prohibit the practice for those
products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
of the WCL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.

  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the WCL assures that
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS

  0. Definitions.

  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
works, such as semiconductor masks.

  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
on the Program.

  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
public, and in some countries other activities as well.

  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

  An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.

  A member of the working class is a "phisical person".

  From our point of view, "a person is not in the working class" if:
  + He/She is creating salaries for other people.
  + He/She has a charge with a salary in a political party.
  + He/She works with guns for the state or a company (police,
  militar, etc.)

  With this definition, we will have a trouble with strong
unequalities in the economy of the working class. We can provide a
mechanism to declare economy. So an economy three times upper to the
average economy could be detected and create new clauses with this
people.
